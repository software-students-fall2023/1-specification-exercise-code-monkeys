## Stakeholders

Interviewee: Michael Park - college student

Goals/Needs:
 - Knowing the type of music his friends like to listen to
 - Direct comparison to what other people are listening to
 - More social interaction on music platforms
 - Being able to write reviews for public opinion

Problems/Frustrations:
- Limited music discovery based on social interactions. Only getting reccomendations through personal data
- Lack of community or group interaction
- Platforms dont have any criticism/ratings for users to understand public opinion on the music
- Lack of shareability of music taste. It is hard to descriptively share what you are listening to.

## Product Vision Statement

Our vision is to create a dynamic community where users can effortlessly rank, discover, and share music to engage meaningful conversations around music. 

## User Requirements

- As a user, I want to be able to sign up for an account so that I can access and utilize the features and services provided by the application.
- As a user, I want to be able to compare albums with one another and choose which one I like better in order to rank them all. 
- As a user, I want to be able to see the calculated 1-10 star rating on the albums I have rated so I can see my own ranking of albums.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how my friends rate albums they listen to so that I know what they like or what they think about the music.
- As a user, I want to be able to compare my ratings with my friends ratings on an album so that I could see the difference in our opinions.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the albums I have ever rated so that I can keep track of and rank everything that I listened to.
- As a user, I want to be able to make lists with the albums I enjoy so that I can remember my favorite albums.
- As a user, I want to be able to share the lists I make so that my friends and other people can see my music taste.
- As a user, I want to be able to react to the lists that are shared with me so that I can tell them what I think. 
- As a user, I want music reccommendations based on my friends' lists so that I can discover new music from different perspectives.
