## Stakeholders

Interviewee: Michael Park - college student

Goals/Needs:
 - Knowing the type of music his friends like to listen to
 - Direct comparison to what other people are listening to
 - More social interaction on music platforms
 - Being able to write reviews for public opinion

Problems/Frustrations:
- Limited music discovery based on social interactions. Only getting reccomendations through personal data
- Lack of community or group interaction
- Platforms dont have any criticism/ratings for users to understand public opinion on the music
- Lack of shareability of music taste. It is hard to descriptively share what you are listening to.

## Product Vision Statement

Our vision is to create a dynamic community where users can effortlessly rank, discover, and share music to engage meaningful conversations around music.
